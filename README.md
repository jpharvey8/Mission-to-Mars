# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
This project required us to scrape text and images from various websites that mentioned the Mission to Mars. We used the Flask web application which allowed us to collect and display the necessary data in one location without having to manually search for each portion. Using the Mongo database, we were able to store the scraped data.

## Resources 
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
The final product included a functional web application with images, a table that compared Mars and Earth, and the latest article title and short description scraped from the NASA's webpage.
